# Part 2: Critique a Computational research paper

## 1

Is the internet causing political polarization?

## 2

American National Election Studies’ (ANES) 1948–2012 Time
Series Cumulative, 2008 Time Series Study, and 2012 Time Series Study data sets.

## 3

Starts from theoretical claims about the internet causing political polarization.
E.g. echo chambers

## 4

Descriptive study. Simply calculating indices of polarization from different demographic groups. Some efforts to identify causal effects informally from results.

## 5

Condensed 9 different indices of polarization into a single index, and then calculated over 1996-2012.
Using this index it appears that groups with lower internet usage actually have higher polarization.

## 6

1. Argue more clearly why a simple average of these arbitrary 9 indices is a good index.

1. Do more validation to show that age is correlated with internet usage. Investigate other correlates of age, e.g. a more pluralistic education.
