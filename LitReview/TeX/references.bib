abstract="In modern societies the demand for mobility is increasing daily. One challenge to researchers dealing with transportation is to find efficient ways to model and predict traffic flow, even if the behaviour of people in traffic is not a trivial problem. The social nature of traffic (e.g. coordinated decisions) seems to be a key question, not well explored. We aim at creating a model of drivers as social agents, thus allowing their behaviour to be predicted and considered in the simulation. This may, on its turn, improve the accuracy of the existing Advanced Travel Information Systems (ATIS).",
