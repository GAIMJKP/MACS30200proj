\autocite{turner2007axial} is an influential paper in the new space of transport network analysis. I will build upon the methodology of treating streets as a network.

\section{Social determinants of traffic}

\autocite{10.2307/1911814} . I am inspired by this to investigate how much drivers respond to special events, and how much private individuals decrease their driving at times of high demand.

\autocite{10.1007/3-540-48238-5_28} The first major paper to treat drivers as social beings and investigate the social causes of traffic.

In my paper this class, I will probably just choose one of the following topics to analyze, with a comparison between two cities.

\subsection{Transport}

When there is a public transport shutdown, how many displaced passengers move onto the road. How elastic is the decision to drive to the amount of traffic on the road?

Consider \href{https://medium.com/uber-movement/examining-the-impact-of-the-london-tower-bridge-closure-5b7626e44915?lang=en-US}{this} Medium article on the London Bridge closure affecting other traffic.
